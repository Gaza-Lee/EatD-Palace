          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>
            EatD Palace began as a simple dream shared over a kitchen table. We
            wanted to create a place where food tells a story, community gathers
            naturally, and every guest leaves feeling nourished in body and
            spirit. Founded in 1995 by Von Hassel, our journey started with a
            love for authentic flavors, time-honored recipes, and the belief
            that dining should be more than just a meal. It should be an
            experience. What began as a modest neighborhood eatery has grown
            into a beloved local destination, still guided by the same values:
            quality, care, and connection. Over the years, we've stayed true to
            our roots while evolving with the seasons and the tastes of our
            guests. Our chefs continue to draw inspiration from global
            traditions and local harvests, crafting dishes that honor the past
            while embracing the present. Thank you for being part of our story.
            We're honored to share our table with you today, tomorrow, and for
            many meals to come.
